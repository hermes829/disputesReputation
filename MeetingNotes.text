### To Dos
	+ How does ICSID define concluded cases as a separate check [ wins minus losses ]
	+ Also make sure you're not counting settlements...these should be an actual positive 
	+ Karen will look into whether or not countries refuse to pay based upon settlements
	+ Magnitude of case
	+ Time of case
	+ Sector of economy
	+ We can also use UNCTAD cases as a separate check
	+ Also check out what is going on with net FDI inflows
	+ Add in sovereign ratings
	+ Control for whether you're a member of the ICSID
	+ IMF programs cancelled
		- Across different domains this so called reputational anchor is not working, cancelled your IMF program
		- Other international commitments...international transparency literature, guidelines on standardization of national accounts

### Model Covariates (long and short term, so lagged variable and change)
	+ GDP
	+ GDP growth
	+ Polity / Polity^2 / Change in polity / Years in democracy
	+ Banks conflict index
	+ Trade balance
	+ BITs
	+ Settlement of concluded cases [[ would be fun if there was a positive relationship ]]
	+ Inflation
	+ Dummy for upper income (World Bank Classification)
	+ ICSID disputes
	+ Spatial disputes [ distance ]
	+ FDI
	+ Natural resource
		- Possible interaction between this and ICSID disputes

### Backup Robustness Checks
	+ Banking, currency, or economic crisis

### Types of modeling strategies
	+ One stage error correction model with prop rights as DV
	+ Two stage error correction model
		- first stage look at what predicts disputes
		- second stage those that have disputes what is effect on proprights
	+ Split population approach

### To dos
	+ Additional data needs
		- Dummy for upper income
		- Sector of economy where dispute is concentrated
		- Member of ICSID
		- violating other international commitments
			+ expropriation
		- sovereign ratings
	+ Dataset modifications
		- I need to create a spatial version of the BITs variable
		- Instead of cumulative disputes measure need to put in an indicator of whether or not there was a dispute in a year
	+ Modeling strategy
		- Need to figure out how to incorporate ECM code into R
	+ Things to email Karen about
		- sector of economy for dispute
		- concluded cases includes settlements
