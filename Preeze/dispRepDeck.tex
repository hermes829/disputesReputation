\frametitle{Why ICSID Matters for FDI}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Disputes at ICSID signal to the investment community that this country is not serious about property rights protection
	\item central purpose of the ICSID is to facilitate international flows of private investment by removing non-commercial risks and providing investors with access to impartial and flexible dispute settlement procedures
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\frametitle{ICSID is a special place}

Compared to other venues, however, the ICSID is distinctive in four major respects. 

\begin{itemize}
	\item First, ICSID arbitration accounts for a higher percentage of treaty-based investment disputes than all of the other legal alternatives put together: a total of 57\% as of the end of 2014 as compared to 27\% for UNCITRAL.
	\item  Second, the ICSID is distinctive in terms of its visibility as an institution formally affiliated with the World Bank with broad legal authority. Under the ICSID Convention, awards are binding on the parties to a dispute and enforceable as if they were final awards of national courts, with the ICSID’s narrowly delimited annulment rules establishing the only avenue of appeal. Awards can thus be enforced in any country that adheres to the ICSID Convention. 
	\item Third, unlike other international arbitration bodies, the ICSID maintains a public record of arbitral claims, making information about allegations of investment treaty violations available to the international community. 
	% For this reason, investor-state dispute arbitration within the ICSID framework is often assumed to carry high reputational costs, creating incentives for states to capitulate to foreign investor demands.
\end{itemize}

\end{frame}

\begin{frame}
\frametitle{Breaking Commitments}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Simmons: ``The acceptance of treaty obligations raises expectations about behavior that, once made, are reputationally costly for governments to violate.'' 
	\item Buthe and Milner: ``Violating an institutionalized commitment – or not making amends to correct a violation that has occurred – damages a country's reputation for keeping commitments, making future cooperation on the same and other issues more difficult and maybe impossible to achieve.'' 
	\item Schwenzer and Hachem: ``The reputation of a State may be damaged by wrongfully initiated investment treaty arbitration against the State. Such harm to reputation may have quite severe financial consequences for the entire economy of the State concerned.'' 
	\item Allee and Peinhardt: ``The filing of a case before ICSID immediately brands the respondent country as an actor that is hostile to investors'' and leads to ``substantial losses in FDI.''
\end{itemize}

% existing literature thus suggests that by raising ex post reputational costs, formal international commitments create incentives for state compliance

% Arguments emphasizing the importance of reputation also run from compliance to government reputation as illustrated by Allee and Peinhart’s analysis of the impact of investor-state disputes.

\begin{block}
Our first goal is to prove an actual assessment of whether breaking these commitments has any effects on reputation.

\frametitle{Role of Information Flows}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Investor-state dispute arbitration have not only produced inconsistent results, but even opposing ones in parallel cases involving identical sets of facts and parties but different treaties and arbitral tribunals. 
	% The outcome of dispute arbitration is therefore rather uncertain and the meaning and significance of arbitral awards, whether positive, negative, or inconclusive with respect to a government charged with treaty violations, limited to the specifics of a particular dispute. 
	% Given the narrow, decentralized, and unpredictable nature of the monitoring and sanctioning processes, the assumption that alleged investment treaty violations generate significant reputational costs is questionable, particularly since reputations are presumably not only rather sticky but also constructed around multiple observations.
	\item Compounding this limitation is a second characteristic of investment dispute settlement procedures: namely, information about an investment dispute may remain too limited to allow the investment community to gauge the extent to which treaty violations have occurred, especially for cases arbitrated confidentially. 
	% Even for claims involving the relatively public ICSID arbitration process, information regarding the specifics of a case may remain restricted if both parties do not consent to the publication of the award rendered by an arbitral tribunal. 
	% To add to the lack of transparency, between 1987 and 2014, 40.4\% of disputes were settled or discontinued before being formally arbitrated, preventing the facts of a dispute from being publicly disclosed. Such limitations on transparency come at the cost of effective reputational sanctions. In the succinct formulation of North, “By making available the relevant information, institutions make possible the policing of defections.”
