\subsection{Major Comments}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item In the revised manuscript, the abstract is too long. I strongly believe that the authors can cut down the abstract and make it succinct. I personally am not a big fan of copying the long paragraph of contributions from the Introduction and pasting it to abstract. If you think mentioning contributions in abstract is an effective way for your work, please paraphrase it and make it short in abstract. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textcolor{blue}{ \emph{ 
		We thank the reviewer for her/his comments and have shortened the abstract.

	\end{itemize}
	\item You still need your hypotheses on FDI flows, too. Currently, your H1 and H2 all deal with only the second question of your study, regarding a reputational change. You are also testing the first question on a FDI flow in the previous section, so please provide relevant hypotheses for readers. 
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textcolor{blue}{ \emph{ 
		We thank the reviewer for her/his comments. However, we have refrained from adding in an explicit hypothesis about FDI flows because our main focus in this paper is on assessing the effects of ISDS on reputation more directly. We attempt to do this via the ICRG, Heritage, and Fraser measures.
