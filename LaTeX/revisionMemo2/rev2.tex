\section{Reviewer 2}

\subsection{Major Comments}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item In the revised manuscript, the abstract is too long. I strongly believe that the authors can cut down the abstract and make it succinct. I personally am not a big fan of copying the long paragraph of contributions from the Introduction and pasting it to abstract. If you think mentioning contributions in abstract is an effective way for your work, please paraphrase it and make it short in abstract. Second, regarding my previous comment #2, it is still odd how you locate your hypotheses in this revised manuscript. This is understandable, though, since this paper claims two separate but closely related questions on 1) a FDI flow and 2) a Reputation change. Given that, you still need your hypotheses on FDI flows, too. Currently, your H1 and H2 all deal with only the second question of your study, regarding a reputational change. You are also testing the first question on a FDI flow in the previous section, so please provide relevant hypotheses for readers. These two points are very easy to address and I believe the authors could quickly amend them.
