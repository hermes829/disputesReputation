Dear colleague,

We now have two excellent reports on the paper you resubmitted to International Interactions some weeks ago, "The Reputational Impact of Investor State Disputes" (GINI-2017-1212.R1). The evaluations, as you can see at the foot of this letter, are generally supportive but also raise some important considerations. I would therefore like to conditionally accept your paper for publication. We would need the next version of the article as early as possible, but at the latest by 30-May-2018.

As you will see from the reviewer suggestions, there are some changes that should be made, but this draft of your paper shows great promise and we are looking forward to working with you on the final version of the manuscript. Please tell me within the coming days when you would be able to send us a revised version.

One of the reviewers is still critical of the data that you are using. Please include an extended discussion of the pros and cons of this source in the next version. I also agree that the abstract needs to be shortened, but please extend the intro with a brief summary of the research design and the main findings. The appendix should be transformed into an "Online appendix". Finally, please take close look at the style guide during the revisions of your excellent article.

Please send us the data that you used for the reported analysis plus the code and any log files as all authors are required to send us their replication material together with the final version of the article. This should be emailed to ii_journal@pitt.edu, and the manuscript number and title noted. We will check these and the replication material will be made available electronically at the same time that the electronic version of the article is released.

In order to formally accept your article, we will need to check that the replication materials reproduce the analyses you present, including the tables and figures, as well as numerical evidence cited in the text. Please submit your code and data, as well as information on any software and libraries/dependencies that will be necessary for us to do this. You should not use absolute links and file-paths when referencing code and data, but relative paths that will work across systems. In addition, clear directions in a simple text file is helpful alongside the code, as well as extensive comments within the code which identifies the place in the manuscript you present the specific result or figure that is being produced. Following these guidelines will not only help future potential replicators build on your work, but also ensure that we do not have to send the manuscript and materials back for further revisions and information, delaying publication.

In revising your manuscript, please also follow the style guide for International Interactions, which is attached along with data policy.

To revise your manuscript, log into https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=https-3A__mc.manuscriptcentral.com_gini&d=DwIFaQ&c=nE__W8dFE-shTxStwXtp0A&r=-DqL-vqQBWL9e8H_v2DgjA&m=RQs18hf8py1Cf6RgxK3ZPg-kSgLZ2TJ-pSVhmLqCdgg&s=NFP0rumcBelNmHVGDvjcOxOOc1lJ_Qr3077_D24efYo&e= and enter your Author Center, where you will find your manuscript title listed under "Manuscripts with Decisions." Under "Actions," click on "Create a Revision." Your manuscript number has been appended to denote a revision.

You will be unable to make your revisions on the originally submitted version of the manuscript. Instead, revise your manuscript using a word processing program and save it on your computer. Once the revised manuscript is prepared, you can upload it and submit it through your Author Center.
When submitting your revised manuscript, you will be able to respond to the comments made by the reviewers in the space provided. Please use this space to document any changes you make to the manuscript at this stage. In order to expedite the processing of the revised manuscript, please be as specific as possible in your response to the reviewers. Even though the manuscript is conditionally accepted, we will still be reviewing it in house.

In addition, this revision, since it has been conditionally accepted, does not have to be anonymous. Please feel free to check the box for anonymous submissions to move the process forward when prompted.

If you have any questions about directions for revisions, please do not hesitate to contact me.

IMPORTANT: Your original files are available to you when you upload your revised manuscript. Please delete any redundant files before completing the submission.

I look forward to receiving your final manuscript. Thank you for your interest in International Interactions.

Sincerely,
Professor Gerald Schneider
co-Editor of International Interactions

Reviewer: 1
Thank you for the revisions and explanations.
I remain unconvinced that the main methodological problem -- the use of an, in my view, inadequate dataset as dependent variable -- can be remedied at this stage. A totally different study design would be required, using meaningful data that reflects companies' confidence as claimed.
You are not convinced by the literature that explains why the dataset is inadequate, and I don't find the your response satisfying. If Kerner's example of FDI data for Moldova and Poland does not convince you that FDI data is not a valid measure of confidence to put money in a potential perilous place, I wonder what does.
I recognise that there are dozens of published studies that use this dataset to assess something in the context of BITs, but that does not make it any better. It only shows that research teams often remain homogeneous and do not cross disciplines (in this case involving someone who has a solid understanding of investment treaties and associated institutions, or on the way FDI data are compiled).
I am also not convinced by the responses to the other aspects. The imitation of shortcomings of earlier studies makes sense if the sole purpose is to show that these other authors were right or wrong (on other grounds) -- as you do for Allee&Peinhardt --, but does not produce genuinely useful findings for the research hypothesis. If the purpose is to show that others were wrong, that should be flagged. If the purpose is to make a valid statement on an observable fact, then imitation of earlier errors is a rather poor approach.
There is dire need for the study of the effects of IIAs and associated institutions, but research should move away from the oft-repeated BITs-and-FDI-data setup that almost totally dominates the field and is flawed on data for both variables (the Energy Charter Treaty has clocked up almost 15% of cases now, and NAFTA follows closely, so keeping to ignore these treaties and cases is almost as unforgivable as using FDI data).
That being said, an interesting research question that merits a close look (using, for instance, firm-level data). I also truly believe that the manuscript has greatly improved.

Reviewer: 2
I would recommend this manuscript, entitled “The Reputational Impact of Investor-State Disputes,” accepted for publication in the International Interactions after addressing the following minor points. The authors seemed to have properly addressed my comments and incorporated my suggestions in their revised manuscript and provide justifications when they do not agree with another reviewer's/my comments and suggestions. I believe the revised manuscript flows much better now. Thus, if they consider and address the following two minor points, this manuscript could be ready to be accepted for publication.

In the revised manuscript, the abstract is too long. I strongly believe that the authors can cut down the abstract and make it succinct. I personally am not a big fan of copying the long paragraph of contributions from the Introduction and pasting it to abstract. If you think mentioning contributions in abstract is an effective way for your work, please paraphrase it and make it short in abstract. Second, regarding my previous comment #2, it is still odd how you locate your hypotheses in this revised manuscript. This is understandable, though, since this paper claims two separate but closely related questions on 1) a FDI flow and 2) a Reputation change. Given that, you still need your hypotheses on FDI flows, too. Currently, your H1 and H2 all deal with only the second question of your study, regarding a reputational change. You are also testing the first question on a FDI flow in the previous section, so please provide relevant hypotheses for readers. These two points are very easy to address and I believe the authors could quickly amend them.
