  pages = {183-201},
  number = {2},
  abstract = {Over a period of time two nations establish between them an interaction
	range which they perceive as "normal." This normal relations range
	(on a scale from very friendly to very hostile) tends to incorporate
	most of a dyad's interactions and is bound by upper and lower critical
	thresholds. Conflict escalation is the movement to above the upper
	critical threshold, and conflict reduction is the return to below
	that threshold. Using the frequency and intensity of inter-nation
	events data coded from the 1956 Suez crisis (from July 26, 1956,
	through January 11, 1957) and a thirteen-point scaling instrument,
	the author shows that during the escalation phase (in comparison
	with preescalation and with conflict reduction phases) conflicting
	parties tend to (a) exhibit a symmetrical pattern of hostile interactions
	and (b) reduce the chronological time intervening between consecutive
	hostile interactions. Furthermore he shows that during conflict reduction
	the conflicting parties tend to exhibit (c) asymmetrical hostile
	interaction patterns and (d) increase the chronological time (or
	temporal distance) between consecutive hostile events. In an exploratory
	hypothesis the author suggests that conflicting dyads tend to reduce
	their hostile interactions to within their normal relations range
	when (1) they achieve or frustrate their goals, (2) incur heavy costs,
	or (3) they feel pressured by changes in the domestic and international
	environments.},

	a midsized town in the midwestern United States. Precise images and
	measures of network structure are derived from reports of relationships
	that occurred over a period of 18 months between 1993 and 1995. The
	study offers a comparison of the structural characteristics of the
	observed network to simulated networks conditioned on the distribution
	of ties; the observed structure reveals networks characterized by
	longer contact chains and fewer cycles than expected. This article
	identifies the micromechanisms that generate networks with structural
	features similar to the observed network. Implications for disease
	transmission dynamics and social policy are explored. },

  abstract = {Box-Steffensmeier and Jones (1997) provide a good overview of the
	class of models known as "event history" or "duration" models, but
	omit some important points about the relationship between duration
	dependence and time-varying data in parametric models of duration.
	The key reason to use duration analysis methods is to allow for the
	possibility of duration dependence in one's data. However, while
	assumptions about the form of duration dependence appear to be purely
	methodological, duration dependence can have important substantive
	implications for theories of politics. There is often an interaction
	in estimation between duration dependence and covariates. In particular,
	duration dependence can be revealed or eliminated when particular
	time-varying variables are included in or removed from a model. This
	point is especially important because time-varying covariates are
	more central and common to important research questions than is sometimes
	realized. Overall, these points lead to the conclusion that findings
	about duration dependence go hand-in-hand with proper specification
	and that model specification both in terms of functional form and
	included variables must be carefully considered before duration methods
	are applied.},

  year = {2004},
  volume = {41},
  pages = {659-676},
  number = {6},
  abstract = {An important question in the conflict processes literature concerns
	what types of international relationships are more likely to lead
	to peaceful interactions. Both security and economic ties have been
	posited as powerful determinants of conflict, yet their effects are
	often examined independently from one another. Furthermore, a debate
	exists as to whether it is states' ties to the international order
	or to each other that are most important in determining conflict.
	A resolution of the competing perspectives would expect that two
	states that have a tight network of security and economic relationships,
	both to each other and to the international order, should be extremely
	unlikely to engage in hostile action against each other. Surprisingly,
	a series of multinomial logits using non-directed dyads from 1951
	to 1985 suggests that dyads with tight economic and security ties
	at both the state-to-state and state-to-system levels are only slightly
	less likely to engage in dyadic disputes than those without such
	simultaneous ties. However, this study finds that both (1) tight
	security and economic ties to the international order and (2) tight
	intra-dyadic security and economic ties have important, independent
	effects in limiting dyadic hostility. This suggests that the states
	within a dyad have two separate paths to more peaceful interactions
	- the first lies in tightening ties between states, the second in
	strengthening dyadic security and economic ties to the international
	order.},

	is more likely to occur between states that are geographically proximate,

	that are not. Bivariate analyses of these seven factors in relation
	to the onset of interstate war over all pairs of states in the period
	from 1816 to 1965 generally support these associations. However,
	multivariate analyses reveal some differences. In order of declining
	importance, the conditions that characterize a dangerous, war-prone
	dyad are: presence of contiguity, absence of alliance, absence of
	more advanced economy, absence of democratic polity, absence of overwhelming
	preponderance, and presence of major power. Taken together these
	findings suggest that our research priorities may be seriously distorted
	and that the idealist prescription for peace may be better than the
	realist one.},

  abstract = {The authors draw on Klinenberg's (2002) ethnography and recent neighborhood
	theory to explain community-level variation in mortality during the
	July 1995 Chicago heat wave. They examine the impact of neighborhood
	structural disadvantage on heat wave mortality and consider three
	possible intervening mechanisms: social network interaction, collective
	efficacy, and commercial conditions. Combining Census and mortality
	data with the 1995 Project on Human Development in Chicago Neighborhoods
	Community Survey and Systematic Social Observation, the authors estimate
	hierarchical Poisson models of death rates both during the 1995 heat
	wave and comparable, temporally proximate July weeks (1990-94, 1996).
	They find that neighborhood affluence was negatively associated with
	heat wave mortality. Consistent with Klinenberg's ethnographic study
	of the Chicago heat wave, commercial decline was positively associated
	with heat wave mortality and explains the affluence effect. Where
	commercial decline was low, neighborhoods were largely protected
	from heat-related mortality. Although social network interaction
	and collective efficacy did not influence heat wave mortality, collective
	efficacy was negatively associated with mortality during comparable
	July weeks (when no heat wave occurred). Unequal distribution of
	community-based resources had important implications for geographic
	differences in survival rates during the Chicago heat wave, and may
	be relevant for other disasters.},

	capital. Opinion and behavior are more homogeneous within than between
	groups, so people connected across groups are more familiar with
	alternative ways of thinking and behaving. Brokerage across the structural
	holes between groups provides a vision of options otherwise unseen,
	which is the mechanism by which brokerage becomes social capital.
	I review evidence consistent with the hypothesis, then look at the
	networks around managers in a large American electronics company.
	The organization is rife with structural holes, and brokerage has
	its expected correlates. Compensation, positive performance evaluations,
	promotions, and good ideas are disproportionately in the hands of
	people whose networks span structural holes. The between-group brokers
	are more likely to express ideas, less likely to have ideas dismissed,
	and more likely to have ideas evaluated as valuable. I close with
	implications for creativity and structural change. },

	and preferential trade agreements (PTAs)?rovide mechanisms for making
	commitments to foreign investors about the treatment of their assets,
	thus reassuring investors and increasing investment. These international
	commitments are more credible than domestic policy choices, because
	reneging on them is more costly. Statistical analyses for 122 developing
	countries from 1970 to 2000 support this argument. Developing countries
	that belong to the WTO and participate in more PTAs experience greater
	FDI inflows than otherwise, controlling for many factors including
	domestic policy preferences and taking into account possible endogeneity.
	Joining international trade agreements allows developing countries
	to attract more FDI and thus increase economic growth.},

	their control over disputed territory to improve their ability to
	fight effectively on it. The empirical analysis suggests that when
	territory is strategically located, target states are more likely
	to consolidate their position, while challenger states are less likely

	characteristics such as strategic location makes consolidation an

	specifically for this project, we systematically examine the new
	international borders of the twentieth century resulting from secession,
	partition, and the use of force. New international borders, we find,
	are drawn not according to principles of ``nationalism'' or defensible
	borders, but rather according to previous administrative frontiers.
	How borders are drawn has important consequences for international
	stability: borders drawn along previously existing internal or external
	administrative frontiers experience fewer future territorial disputes
	and have a much lower risk of militarized confrontation if a dispute

	phenomenon as a constant and universal law operating at the state
	level, the author follows Immanuel Kant and treats democratic cooperation
	as an emergent macroprocess. The current study explores three causal
	mechanisms. First, strategic tagging introduces a way for democracies
	to select out like-minded cooperators. Second, regime-sensitive alliances
	enable democratic states to defend the gains of cooperation. Third,
	liberal collective security complements the liberal alignments. Based
	on these processes, it is possible to "grow" cooperative outcomes
	in an inhospitable geopolitical environment. Because tagging alone
	is insufficient, alliances, and sometimes even collective security,
	are necessary to produce perpetual peace. Such outcomes are characterized
	by high levels of spatial clustering. },

  abstract = {Computational modeling is used to improve our understanding of how
	the democratic peace unfolds as a historical process in time and
	space. Whereas most of the conventional literature interprets the
	phenomenon as a constant and universal law operating at the state
	level, the author follows Immanuel Kant and treats democratic cooperation
	as an emergent macroprocess. The current study explores three causal
	mechanisms. First, strategic tagging introduces a way for democracies
	to select out like-minded cooperators. Second, regime-sensitive alliances
	enable democratic states to defend the gains of cooperation. Third,
	liberal collective security complements the liberal alignments. Based
	on these processes, it is possible to "grow" cooperative outcomes
	in an inhospitable geopolitical environment. Because tagging alone
	is insufficient, alliances, and sometimes even collective security,
	are necessary to produce perpetual peace. Such outcomes are characterized
	by high levels of spatial clustering. },

	for norms and social structure in global politics. Theoretically,

	typically fail to explain the origins of such structures, how they
	change over time, how their effects vary cross nationally, or the
	mechanisms through which they constitute states and individuals.
	Missing is the substantive theory and attention to agency that will
	provide answers to such puzzles, as well as ensure the development

	argues that foreign states behave strategically in order to (a) avoid
	becoming the targets of domestically troubled executives or (b) to
	take advantage of the domestic trouble another state endures. Such
	"strategic interaction" delimits the set of foreign policies reasonably
	available to leaders in trouble at home, thus producing the impetus
	for policy substitution. This article develops a theoretical model
	of strategic behavior and policy substitution and reports empirical
	results of a multivariate probit model.},

  abstract = {For decades, scholars have wrestled with the assumption that old age
	is characterized by social isolation. However, there has been no
	systematic, nationally representative evaluation of this possibility
	in terms of social network connectedness. In this article, we develop
	a profile of older adults' social integration with respect to nine
	dimensions of interpersonal networks and voluntary associations.
	We use new data from the National Social Life, Health, and Aging
	Project (NSHAP), a population-based study of non-institutionalized
	older Americans ages 57 to 85, conducted in 2005 to 2006. Results
	suggest that among older adults, age is negatively related to network
	size, closeness to network members, and number of non-primary-group
	ties. On the other hand, age is positively related to frequency of
	socializing with neighbors, religious participation, and volunteering.
	In addition, age has a U-shaped relationship with volume of contact
	with network members. These findings are inconsistent with the view
	that old age has a universal negative influence on social connectedness.
	Instead, life-course factors have divergent consequences for different
	forms of social connectedness. Indeed, some later life transitions,
	such as retirement and bereavement, may prompt greater connectedness.
	We conclude by urging increased dialogue between social gerontological
	and social network research.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT Beck, King, and Zeng (2000) offer both a sweeping critique
	of the quantitative security studies field and a bold new direction
	for future research. Despite important strengths in their work, we
	take issue with three aspects of their research: (1) the substance
	of the logit model they compare to their neural network, (2) the
	standards they use for assessing forecasts, and (3) the theoretical
	and model-building implications of the nonparametric approach represented
	by neural networks. We replicate and extend their analysis by estimating
	a more complete logit model and comparing it both to a neural network
	and to a linear discriminant analysis. Our work reveals that neural
	networks do not perform substantially better than either the logit
	or the linear discriminant estimators. Given this result, we argue
	that more traditional approaches should be relied upon due to their
	enhanced ability to test hypotheses.},

	asymmetrical dyads. In this theory, the interaction of two conditions--the
	state of a nation's economy and the extent of concentration in its
	linkages with a superordinate power--is used to explain the foreign
	policy actions of the subordinate state toward the superordiuate
	country. Directed dyads are divided into asymmetrical and nonasymmetrical
	sets, and the hypotheses are tested over both sets via regression
	analysis. The findings confirm the importance of structural asymmetry
	as a scope condition on the theory but offer only limited support
	for the use of the economic strength and linkage concentration variables
	in the explanation of foreign policy. The results also reveal that
	the influence of these two variables on foreign policy is not precisely
	as stipulated by the theory. For the more developed African states,
	relative economic strength in combination with highly concentrated
	linkages is associated, contrary to the theory, with a foreign policy
	of expanded relations with superordinate partners. For the less-developed
	states, this combination produces a foreign policy designed to restrict
	relations within the asymmetrical dyad as predicted by the theory.},

  abstract = {International peacebuilding can improve the prospects that a civil
	war will be resolved. Although peacebuilding strategies must be designed
	to address particular conflicts, broad parameters that fit most conflicts
	can be identified. Strategies should address the local roots of hostility,
	the local capacities for change, and the (net) specific degree of
	international commitment available to assist sustainable peace. One
	can conceive of these as the three dimensions of a triangle whose
	area is the "political space"-or effective capacity-for building
	peace. We test these propositions with an extensive data set of 124
	post-World War II civil wars and find that multilateral, United Nations
	peace operations make a positive difference. UN peacekeeping is positively
	correlated with democratization processes after civil war, and multilateral
	enforcement operations are usually successful in ending the violence.
	Our study provides broad guidelines for designing the appropriate
	peacebuilding strategy, given the mix of hostility, local capacities,
	and international capacities.},

	two, and only two, distinct communities dominate the political arena.
	The concept of a bicommunal polity is analytical rather than statistical.
	Permanent asymmetry characterizing the two components makes a simple
	majoritarian formula for decisionmaking processes unacceptable. What
	other decisional frameworks have a greater chance for success: federalism,
	federalism with a heavy dose of confederal ingredients, regional
	confederation, consociationalism or secession? A confederal modification
	of federalism has so far appeared as more acceptable to two asymmetric
	and antagonistic polities than a concept of a federal union with
	ts commitment to an overarching cultural-political national union.
	The high failure rate of bicommunal configurations points also to
	the necessity to relate the inner working of bicommunal polities
	to international balancing processes and/or support or abstinence
	of "blood-related" nation-states.},

	state leaders might employ in trying to credibly communicate their
	foreign policy interests to other states, whether in the realm of
	grand strategy or crisis diplomacy. Leaders might either (a) tie
	hands by creating audience costs that they will suffer ex post if
	they do not follow through on their threat or commitment (i.e., costs
	arising from the actions of domestic political audiences) or (b)
	sink costs by taking actions such as mobilizing troops that are financially
	costly ex ante. Analysis of a game model depicting the essentials
	of each case yields two principal results. First, in the games' equilibria,
	leaders never bluff with either type of signal; they do not incur
	or create costs and then fail to respond if challenged. Second, leaders
	do better on average by tying hands, despite the fact that the ability
	to do so creates a greater ex ante risk of war than does the use
	of sunk-cost signals. These results and the logic behind them may
	help explain some empirical features of international signaling,
	such as many crises' appearance as competitions in creating domestic
	political audience costs. They also generate empirical puzzles, such
	as why the seemingly plausible logic of inference that undermines
	bluffing in the model does not operate in all empirical cases.},

	Popular rationalist and realist explanations for war fail either

	locating a less costly bargain. Essentially just two mechanisms can
	resolve this puzzle on strictly rationalist terms. The first turns
	on the fact that states have both private information about capabilities

  abstract = {An influential conventional wisdom holds that civil wars proliferated
	rapidly with the end of the Cold War and that the root cause of many

	that the current prevalence of internal war is mainly the result
	of a steady accumulation of protracted conflicts since the 1950s
	and 1960s rather than a sudden change associated with a new, post-Cold
	War international system. We also find that after controlling for
	per capita income, more ethnically or religiously diverse countries
	have been no more likely to experience significant civil violence
	in this period. We argue for understanding civil war in this period
	in terms of insurgency or rural guerrilla warfare, a particular form
	of military practice that can be harnessed to diverse political agendas.
	The factors that explain which countries have been at risk for civil
	war are not their ethnic or religious characteristics but rather
	the conditions that favor insurgency. These include poverty-which
	marks financially and bureaucratically weak states and also favors
	rebel recruitment-political instability, rough terrain, and large

	a lack of access to job networks as one of the reasons that African

	research has found, however, that minorities do worse when they use
	personal networks in job finding. Research in this area has been
	hampered by the complicated and multi-step nature of the job-finding
	process and by the lack of appropriate comparison data for demonstrating
	the various ways in which minorities can be isolated from good job
	opportunities. We seek to specify what it means to say that minorities
	are cut off from job networks. Building on the literature on social
	networks in the labor market, we delineate the various mechanisms
	by which minorities can be isolated from good job opportunities.
	We examine how these mechanisms operate, using unique data on the
	chain of network contacts that funnel to an employer offering desirable
	jobs. We find that network factors operate at several stages of the
	recruitment process. We find scant evidence, however, that these
	network factors serve to cut off minorities from employment in this
	setting. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and methodological
	implications of the case for the study of networks, race, and hiring.},

	(a) between nation-states of approximately equal national power (power
	parity) and (b) between geographically proximate nation-states. The
	data base consists of thirty dyadic interstate wars during the period
	1816-1965. The analysis employs four indicators of national power:
	geographical area, population, fuel consumption, and steel production.
	Hypotheses are tested using the Kolmogorov-Smirnov one-sample test.
	The proximity hypothesis is confirmed (p&lt;.01). The power parity
	hypothesis is partially confirmed; except for the steel production
	analysis, all results are in the predicted direction. The population
	hypothesis is confirmed (p&lt;.025), and there is considerable support
	for the geographical area hypothesis (p&lt;.10). The findings justify
	further dyadic and nondyadic analyses and an effort to develop a
	power parity theory of interstate war.},

  abstract = {The relationship between static and dynamic power distributions and
	war is a central element in the realist literature of international
	politics. The distribution of power and shifts in these distributions
	are held to be a principal source of conflict in works from Thucydides
	to Waltz. Most attempts to test empirically for a structural association
	between capability distributions and conflict have treated disputes
	as independent events; however, over the last two centuries a disproportionate
	amount of interstate conflict has occurred in the context of extended
	dyadic rivalries. This study focuses on the conflict patterns of
	these "enduring rivals." Based on a Markov chain analysis of 456
	militarized disputes occurring between 1816 and 1986, the findings
	indicate that power parity and shifts toward parity are approximately
	twice as likely to be associated with war as is a condition of power
	preponderance. By definition, rival dyads have issues in conflict.
	Equality of power or shifts toward equality create a situation in
	which both sides can perceive the potential for successful use of
	force. The findings generated in this analysis indicate that with
	such power distributions war between rival nations is most probable.},

	Using unique retrospective data, the paper first assesses friendship

	across gender and race. QAP regression is used to determine the impact
	of both preference and propinquity (measured by participation in
	joint extra-curricular activities and shared academic major) on friendship
	choice. While preference predicts friendship choice in the freshman
	year, propinquity remains the strongest determinant of friendship

  abstract = {International relations theorists disagree about whether great power
	behaviors reflect bureaucratic routine or reciprocity. Recently,
	some have suggested that these behaviors result from great powers'
	rational expectations rather than from simple routine or reciprocity.
	The debate is flawed in several respects. The quasi-experimental
	studies of great power behavior suffer from specification and measurement
	errors. Furthermore, most studies of great power behavior focus exclusively
	on the superpowers, without adequately appreciating China's role
	in world politics. We present an improved analysis that recognizes
	the potential effects of Chinese behavior and ameliorates the methodological
	flaws in existing work. The results indicate that the behaviors of
	the United States, the Soviet Union, and China are a relatively stable
	mix of bureaucratic routine and reciprocity. The results also indicate
	complex, asymmetrical connections among U.S.-Soviet, U.S.-Chinese,
	and Soviet-Chinese relations, consistent with the notion of a strategic
	triangle.},

  abstract = {The international system is not only an expression of domestic structures,
	but a cause of them. Two schools of analysis exploring the impact
	of the international system upon domestic politics (regime types,
	institutions, coalitions, policies) may be distinguished: those which
	stress the international economy, and those which stress political-military
	rivalry, or war. Among the former are such arguments as: late industrialization
	(associated with Gershenkron); dependencia or core-periphery arguments
	(Wallerstein); liberal development model (much American writing in
	the 50s and 60s); transnational relation-modernization (Nye, Keohane,
	Morse); neo-mercantilists (Gilpin); state-centered Marxists (Schurmann).
	Arguments stressing the role of war include those which focus on
	the organizational requirements of providing security (Hintze, Anderson),
	the special nature of foreign relations (classical political theory),
	territorial compensation (diplomatic history), and strains of foreign
	involvement (analysis of revolutions). These arguments provide the
	basis for criticism of much of the literature which uses domestic
	structure as an explanation of foreign policy, in particular those
	which (such as the strong-state weak-state distinction) tend, by
	excessive focus on forms, to obscure the connection between structures
	and interests, and the role of politics. These arguments also permit
	criticism of the notion of a recent fundamental discontinuity in
	the nature of international relations.},

  number = {4},
  abstract = {This paper asks (a) why and how institutions change, (b) how an institution
	persists in a changing environment, and (c) how processes that it
	unleashes lead to its own demise. The paper shows that the game-theoretic
	notion of self-enforcing equilibrium and the historical institutionalist
	focus on process are both inadequate to answer these questions. Building
	on a game-theoretic foundation, but responding to the critique of
	it by historical institutionalists, the paper introduces the concepts
	of quasi-parameters and self reinforcement. With these concepts,
	and building on repeated game theory, a dynamic approach to institutions
	is offered, one that can account for endogenous change (and stability)
	of institutions. Contextual accounts of formal governing institutions
	in early modern Europe and the informal institution of cleavage structure
	in the contemporary world provide illustrations of the approach.},

	However, this essay's principal argument is that neoliberal institutionalism
	misconstrues the realist analysis of international anarchy and therefore
	it misunderstands realism's analysis of the inhibiting effects of
	anarchy on the willingness of states to cooperate. This essay highlights
	the profound divergences between realism and the newest liberal institutionalism.
	It also argues that the former is likely to be proven analytically
	superior to the latter.},

  abstract = { This study examines whether structural properties of friendship networks
	condition the association between friends' delinquency and an individual's
	own delinquent behavior. Data from the Add Health allows a more accurate
	conceptualization of the peer network and a more rigorous measurement
	of peer delinquency than previous research. Findings from this study
	indicate that friends' delinquency is associated with an adolescent's
	own delinquency involvement. However, characteristics of adolescents'
	friendship networks, such as its density and adolescents' centrality
	and popularity, condition the delinquency-peer association. Network
	density, in particular, emerges as an important component of the
	delinquency-peer association, with very cohesive networks containing
	stronger delinquency-peer associations than those that are less cohesive.
	These findings suggest that it is necessary to consider the underlying
	structural properties of friendship networks in order to understand
	the impact of peer influence on adolescent delinquency. },

	their constituents challenges the long-standing assumption that constituency
	preferences are exogenous to the linkage process, but does not clearly
	suggest the conditions under which a specific pattern of linkage
	should exist. Drawing on a diverse collection of prior research,
	we argue that issues that function as main lines of cleavage between
	competing political parties should be characterized by reciprocal
	linkages between mass and elite preferences, while highly complex
	issues on which party distinctions are unclear should be characterized
	by no linkages between mass and elite. For salient issues on which
	the public fails to distinguish party positions, we expect the traditional
	one-way linkage from mass to elite. We test our theoretical expectations
	with a unique version of the data from the 1958 American Representation
	Study-and with explicit predictions for which policy issues addressed
	in that study should demonstrate which particular pattern of mass-elite
	linkage. The empirical results, derived from LISREL analyses for
	three policy areas, are entirely in accord with our predictions.},

	democracies over the last two centuries. Political battles over trade
	policy appear to have sometimes divided societies along broad class
	lines and at other times split them into narrow industry-based coalitions.
	I argue that this diversity stems from historical and cross-national
	variation in inter-industry factor mobility. Class coalitions are
	more likely where factor mobility is high, whereas narrow, industry-based
	coalitions are more likely where mobility is low. Evidence from six
	Western economies for the last two centuries indicates that levels
	of factor mobility have varied historically and cross-nationally
	in accord with industrialization and regulation. This variation corresponds
	broadly with observable differences in the formation of trade policy
	coalitions.},

	individuals at the same time that they discourage participation among
	lower status individuals. As a result, political activity is more
	highly structured by individual status in higher status contexts

	most pronounced upon political activities which require social interaction,
	and alternative explanations based upon individual attributes do
	not satisfactorily account for the social context's effect.},

	information. Our data base combines a 1984 election survey of citizens
	in South Bend, Indiana with a subsequent survey of people with whom
	these citizens discuss politics. Several findings emerge from the
	effort. First, individuals do purposefully construct informational
	networks corresponding to their own political preferences, and they
	also selectively misperceive socially supplied political information.
	More important, both of these individual-level processes are shown
	to be conditioned by constraints imposed due to the distribution
	of political preferences in the social context. Thus, individual
	control over socially supplied political information is partial and
	incomplete. Finally, these information-transmitting processes interact
	with the social context in a manner that favors partisan majorities
	while undermining political minorities.},

	theoretical frameworks: rational deterrence, a general model of rational
	conflict initiation, and a cognitive psychological model of behavior
	emphasizing risk orientation and misperception. The results of probit
	analysis on a pooled time series of enduring rivalries since 1945
	provide support for hypotheses from each of the different theoretical

	attacker a quick and decisive victory on the battlefield enhances
	deterrence; (2) a policy of reciprocity in diplomacy and military
	actions by the defender contributes strongly to deterrence success;

	in the resolution of territorial disputes from 1945 to 2000. In doing
	so, we focus on three outcomes of interest. First, when do states
	choose to revise the territorial status quo through negotiations
	instead of force? Second, when are states able to reach a final settlement?
	Third, when do states prefer a process of legal dispute resolution
	(i.e., adjudication or arbitration) to bilateral negotiations? To
	answer these questions, we argue that when the legal principles relevant
	to the dispute are unambiguous and clearly favor one side, a law-based
	focal point will emerge. This focal point, in turn, facilitates the
	settlement process by helping leaders overcome distribution problems,
	a central obstacle in reaching a final agreement. We find strong
	and consistent empirical support for our hypotheses regarding international
	law and peaceful dispute resolution.},

	states. The most developed states in the international system-the
	United States, Western Europe, and Japan-form what Karl Deutsch called
	a security community, which is a group of countries among which war
	is unthinkable. These states are the most powerful ones in the world
	and, so, are traditional rivals. Thus the change is striking and
	consequential Constructivists explain this in terms of changed ideas
	and identities; liberals point to democracy and economic interest;
	realists stress the role of nuclear weapons and American hegemony.
	My own explanation combines the high cost of war, the gains from
	peace, and the values that are prevalent within the security community.
	Whatever the cause, the existence of the community will bring with
	it major changes in international politics and calls into question
	many traditional theories of war.},

	attention primarily on changes in the international system. This
	paper attempts to show that foreign economic policy can be understood
	only if domestic factors are systematically included in the analysis.
	The paper's first part groups the recent literature into three paradigms
	which distinguish between three international effects. The second
	part offers a comparison of the differences between a state-centered
	policy network in France and a society-centered network in the United
	States. The third part of the paper combines the arguments of the
	first two and analyzes French and American commercial, financial,
	and energy policies as the outcome of both international effects
	and domestic structures. These case studies show that domestic factors
	must be included in an analysis of foreign economic policies. The
	paper's main results are analyzed further in its fourth part.},

	the claims, forecasts, and causal inferences of the State Failure
	Task Force and its efforts to forecast when states will fail. State
	failure refers to the collapse of the authority of the central government

	politicides, and adverse or disruptive regime transitions. States
	that sponsor terrorism or allow it to be organized within their borders
	are all failed states. This task force, set up at the behest of Vice
	President Gore in 1994, has been led by a group of distinguished
	academics working as consultants to the U.S. CIA. State Failure Task
	Force reports and publications have received attention in the media,

	several methodological errors in the task force work that cause its
	reported forecast probabilities of conflict to be too large, its
	causal inferences to be biased in unpredictable directions, and its
	claims of forecasting performance to be exaggerated. However, the
	article also finds that the task force has amassed the best and most
	carefully collected data on state failure to date, and the required
	corrections provided in this article, although very large in effect,
	are easy to implement. The article also demonstrates how to improve
	forecasting performance to levels significantly greater than even

	highly uncertain endeavor, the authors are nevertheless able to offer
	the first accurate forecasts of state failure, along with procedures
	and results that may be of practical use in informing foreign policy
	decision making. The article also describes a number of strong empirical
	regularities that may help in ascertaining the causes of state failure.},

	using complete network data and arrives at different conclusions.
	Findings emonstrate that similarity in the substance use of teenagers
	and their peers is explained by either peer selection or peer influence
	for some, by both peer selection and peer influence for others, and
	by neither for others. Using a sociological approach and a social
	network perspective this paper demonstrates how chain reactions result
	in similarity in the substance use of teenagers in their peer groups,
	by drawing together those who are similar with those who are not.
	The paper demonstrates how chain reactions involve peer selection,
	the patterning of peer ties and peer influence, and explores how
	gender affects all aspects of the chain reaction process.},

	We argue that international actors are goal-seeking agents who make
	specific institutional design choices to solve the particular cooperation
	problems they face in different issue-areas. In this article we introduce
	the theoretical framework of the Rational Design project. We identify
	five important features of institutions-membership, scope, centralization,
	control, and flexibility-and explain their variation in terms of
	four independent variables that characterize different cooperation
	problems: distribution, number of actors, enforcement, and uncertainty.
	We draw on rational choice theory to develop a series of empirically
	falsifiable conjectures that explain this institutional variation.
	The authors of the articles in this special issue of International
	Organization evaluate the conjectures in specific issue-areas and
	the overall Rational Design approach.},

  abstract = {Why do international institutions vary so widely in terms of such
	key institutional features as membership, scope, and flexibility?
	We argue that international actors are goal-seeking agents who make
	specific institutional design choices to solve the particular cooperation
	problems they face in different issue-areas. In this article we introduce
	the theoretical framework of the Rational Design project. We identify
	five important features of institutions-membership, scope, centralization,
	control, and flexibility-and explain their variation in terms of
	four independent variables that characterize different cooperation
	problems: distribution, number of actors, enforcement, and uncertainty.
	We draw on rational choice theory to develop a series of empirically
	falsifiable conjectures that explain this institutional variation.
	The authors of the articles in this special issue of International
	Organization evaluate the conjectures in specific issue-areas and
	the overall Rational Design approach.},

  abstract = {A unique longitudinal and prospective approach is used to analyze
	the social embeddedness of rural-urban Thai migrants and their subsequent
	migration. More than any one particular social tie, it is the configuration
	of social ties at multiple levels that influences whether migrants
	experience their destination as integrative and a place for settlement
	or not. Social ties at multiple levels and from multiple sources
	weave into a social fabric that surrounds migrants in destination
	contexts, shaping their migration trajectories. The findings show
	that urban-integrated migrants with diverse social support ties in
	the urban destination who reside in village enclaves and households
	that promote social adaptation and incorporation tend to be found
	again in urban destinations 6 years later. By comparison, semi-integrated
	and urban-isolated migrants whose social support ties, community
	structures, and households provide relatively weak links and support
	within the urban setting exhibit stronger tendencies to return to
	their villages of origin or to migrate onward from their initial
	destination. The findings suggest that migrants' mobility pathways-whether
	they settle in their current destination, return to their villages
	of origin, or make additional movements onward-depend on the organization
	of urban social relations and migrants' positions therein.},

  abstract = {The structure of international trade, identified by the degree of
	openness for the movement of goods, can best be explained by a state-power
	theory of international political economy. This theory begins with
	the assumption that the nature of international economic movements
	is determined by states acting to maximize national goals. Four goals--aggregate
	national income, political power, social stability, and economic
	growth--can be systematically related to the degree of openness in
	the international trading system for states of different relative
	sizes and levels of development. This analysis leads to the conclusion
	that openness is most likely to exist when there is a hegemonic distribution
	of potential economic power. Time-series data on tariff levels, trade
	proportions, regional concentration, per capita income, national
	income, share of world trade, and share of world investment are then
	presented. The first three are used to describe the degree of openness
	in the trading system; the last four, the distribution of state power.
	The data suggest that the state-power theory should be amended to
	take into consideration domestic political constraints on state action.},

	control expectations, analyses suggest that athletic involvement
	fails to inhibit male violence. Moreover, there is a strong relationship
	between contact sports and violence. Football players and wrestlers,
	as opposed to baseball, basketball, tennis, and other athletes, are
	significantly more likely than nonathletic males to be involved in
	a serious fight. Additionally, the direct effect of football is explained
	by the football participation of individuals' peers. Males whose
	friends play football are more likely to fight than other males,
	supporting perspectives that emphasize peer contexts as important
	mediators. Overall, findings are consistent with the expectations
	of social learning and masculinity arguments. The theoretical and

	to our understanding of international relations. I begin with the
	implications of loss aversion, the endowment effect, risk orientation,
	and framing for theoretical questions relating to the stability of
	the status quo in international politics, deterrence, bargaining,
	and preventive war. I then raise conceptual and methodological problems
	which complicate the theoretical and empirical application of prospect
	theory to international behavior. I illustrate my arguments with
	references to some recent attempts to use a prospect theory framework
	to guide case studies of crises decision-making. I conclude that
	in applying prospect theory to empirical cases, the analyst must
	demonstrate not only that empirical behavior is consistent with the
	theory but also that the observed behavior cannot adequately be explained
	by a rational choice model which posits the maximization of expected
	value.},

  number = {5},
  month = {October},
  abstract = {This article examines the relationship between different forms of
	cultural taste and the density of social contacts across alternative
	types of network relations classified by average tie strength. The
	author builds on Bourdieu's ([1986] 2001) classic statement on the
	"forms of capital" (economic, social, and cultural) and the conversion
	dynamics among them, and on DiMaggio's (1987) connection between
	cultural tastes and sociability. He hypothesizes that (1) in addition
	to cultural tastes being determined by network relations, cultural
	tastes are used to form and sustain those networks. Furthermore he
	expects that (2) highbrow culture taste will be less likely to be
	converted into social capital beyond immediate strong-tie circles
	due to its more restricted, "asset-specific" nature. Because of its
	generalized appeal, taste for popular culture will be more likely
	to be associated with weak-tie network density. The results broadly
	support these hypotheses: a model that specifies an effect of culture
	on network density provides a better fit to the data than the traditional
	conception of networks as determining taste. In addition using log-linear
	models and instrumental-variable methods, I show that popular culture
	consumption has a positive impact on weak-tie network density but
	not strong-tie network density, while highbrow culture consumption
	selectively increases strong-tie density but has no appreciable effect
	on weak ties, net of standard socioeconomic variables. These findings
	help to shed light on the mechanisms that translate mastery of different
	types of cultural knowledge into integration across distant social
	positions or closure around strong group boundaries. The author also
	discusses the implications of the results for current models describing
	the transformation of cultural into social resources.},

  abstract = {The aim of this paper is to understand the interrelations among relations
	within concrete social groups. Social structure is sought, not ideal
	types, although the latter are relevant to interrelations among relations.
	From a detailed social network, patterns of global relations can
	be extracted, within which classes of equivalently positioned individuals
	are delineated. The global patterns are derived algebraically through
	a 'functorial' mapping of the original pattern. Such a mapping (essentially
	a generalized homomorphism) allows systematically for concatenation
	of effects through the network. The notion of functorial mapping
	is of central importance in the 'theory of categories,' a branch
	of modem algebra with numerous applications to algebra, topology,
	logic. The paper contains analyses of two social networks, exemplifying
	this approach. [ABSTRACT FROM AUTHOR]},

  abstract = {Does a state's use of indiscriminate violence incite insurgent attacks?
	To date, most existing theories and empirical studies have concluded
	that such violence is highly counterproductive because it creates
	new grievances while forcing victims to seek security, if not safety,
	in rebel arms. This proposition is tested using Russian artillery
	fire in Chechnya (2000 to 2005) to estimate indiscriminate violence's
	effect on subsequent patterns of insurgent attacks across matched
	pairs of similar shelled and nonshelled villages. The findings are
	counterintuitive. Shelled villages experience a 24 percent reduction
	in posttreatment mean insurgent attacks relative to control villages.
	In addition, commonly cited "triggers" for insurgent retaliation,
	including the lethality and destructiveness of indiscriminate violence,
	are either negatively correlated with insurgent attacks or statistically
	insignificant.},

  abstract = {Studies of international institutions, organizations, and regimes
	have consistently appeared in the pages of International Organization.
	We review the theoretical and empirical work on international institutions
	and identify promising directions for the institutionalist research
	program. Early studies of international institutions were rich with
	empirical insights and often influenced by theoretical developments
	in other fields of political science, but lacking an overarching
	analytical framework they failed to produce a coherent body of scholarship.
	Current efforts to reinvigorate the study of international institutions
	draw on a new body of theory about domestic institutions. We argue
	that the assumptions of this new approach to institutions are more
	appropriate to international studies than those of earlier attempts
	to transfer theories across levels of analysis. We suggest that the
	most productive questions for future research will focus on specifying
	alternative mechanisms by which institutions can influence outcomes
	and identify particular sets of questions within this agenda that
	are especially promising.},

  abstract = {Have the core discussion networks of Americans changed in the past
	two decades? In 1985, the General Social Survey (GSS) collected the
	first nationally representative data on the confidants with whom
	Americans discuss important matters. In the 2004 GSS the authors
	replicated those questions to assess social change in core network
	structures. Discussion networks are smaller in 2004 than in 1985.
	The number of people saying there is no one with whom they discuss
	important matters nearly tripled. The mean network size decreases
	by about a third (one confidant), from 2.94 in 1985 to 2.08 in 2004.
	The modal respondent now reports having no confidant; the modal respondent
	in 1985 had three confidants. Both kin and non-kin confidants were
	lost in the past two decades, but the greater decrease of non-kin
	ties leads to more confidant networks centered on spouses and parents,
	with fewer contacts through voluntary associations and neighborhoods.
	Most people have densely interconnected confidants similar to them.
	Some changes reflect the changing demographics of the U.S. population.
	Educational heterogeneity of social ties has decreased, racial heterogeneity
	has increased. The data may overestimate the number of social isolates,
	but these shrinking networks reflect an important social change in
	America},

  abstract = {The ubiquitous yet inaccurate belief in international relations scholarship
	that cognitive biases and emotion cause only mistakes distorts the
	field's understanding of the relationship between rationality and
	psychology in three ways. If psychology explains only mistakes (or
	deviations from rationality), then (1) rationality must be free of
	psychology; (2) psychological explanations require rational baselines;
	and (3) psychology cannot explain accurate judgments. This view of
	the relationship between rationality and psychology is coherent and
	logical, but wrong. Although undermining one of these three beliefs
	is sufficient to undermine the others, I address each belief-or myth-in
	turn. The point is not that psychological models should replace rational
	models, but that no single approach has a lock on understanding rationality.
	In some important contexts (such as in strategic choice) or when
	using certain concepts (such as trust, identity, justice, or reputation),
	an explicitly psychological approach to rationality may beat a rationalist
	one.},

  abstract = {Poliheuristic theory (PH) bridges the gap between cognitive and rational
	theories of decision making. PH postulates a two-stage decision process.
	During the first stage, the set of possible options is reduced by
	applying a "noncompensatory principle" to eliminate any alternative
	with an unacceptable return on a critical, typically political, decision
	dimension. Once the choice set has been reduced to alternatives that
	are acceptable to the decision maker, the process moves to a second
	stage, during which the decision maker uses more analytic processing
	in an attempt to minimize risks and maximize benefits. In this article,
	the author applies poliheuristic theory to individual, sequential,
	and interactive decision settings. Subsequent articles in this issue
	offer theoretical extensions and multiple tests of the theory using
	multiple methods (formal, statistical, experimental).},

	that the actions of individuals and firms are affected by the social

	have begun to recognize that the effects of these social networks

	the extent to which the effects of interfirm networks on the behavior
	of firms are historically contingent. Focusing on the level of debt
	financing among approximately 140 large U.S. corporations over a
	22-year period, the authors show that the extent to which the firms'use
	of debt was influenced by those with which they were tied through
	director interlocks declined over time. The authors argue that this
	decline in the network effect reflected a shift in the institutional
	environment within which the firms operated, and that it was driven
	by three processes: the professionalization of the finance function
	within the firm, the internalization of financial decision-making,
	and the increased volatility of the environment. They conclude that
	corporate financing is socially embedded, but this embeddedness is
	historically contingent.},

	its ability to aid scholars in the social sciences to make more accurate

	by pooling information from multiple forecast models to generate
	ensemble predictions similar to a weighted average of component forecasts.
	The weight assigned to each forecast is calibrated via its performance
	in some validation period. The aim is not to choose some {\`O}best{\'O}
	model, but rather to incorporate the insights and knowledge implicit
	in various forecasting efforts via statistical postprocessing. After
	presenting the method, we show that EBMA increases the accuracy of
	out-of-sample forecasts relative to component models in three applied
	examples: predicting the occurrence of insurgencies around the Pacific
	Rim, forecasting vote shares in U.S. presidential elections, and
	predicting the votes of U.S. Supreme Court Justices.},

	Recent work in the sociology of knowledge demonstrates a direct linkage

	I test three competing models for sociological collaboration networks
	and find that a structurally cohesive core that has been growing
	steadily since the early 1960s characterizes the discipline's coauthorship
	network. The results show that participation in the sociology collaboration
	network depends on research specialty and that quantitative work
	is more likely to be coauthored than non-quantitative work. However,
	structural embeddedness within the network core given collaboration
	is largely unrelated to specialty area. This pattern is consistent
	with a loosely overlapping specialty structure that has potentially
	integrative implications for theoretical development in sociology.},

	illustrate the merits of analyzing the dispute rather than the state

	place. Stated generally, the processes of invention the authors discover
	there are transposition, refunctionality, and catalysis across multiple
	social networks. Specifically, political co-optation of cambio bankers
	in the aftermath of the Ciompi revolt induced the transposition of
	domestic guild methods to the international plane, thereby changing
	their purpose and their reach. Subsequent social absorption through
	marriage of these elevated bankers into the victorious political
	alliance infused partnership with the multiplex logic (and often
	money) of dowry, thereby reproducing partnership systems as an integral
	component in post-Ciompi republicanism. Medieval organizational logics
	of patrilineage and guild were transformed into Renaissance organizational
	logics of marriage and clientage. The origins of financial capitalism
	are partly rooted in this elite social-network response to class
	revolt.},

	and each is related to the foreign policy behavior of the exporters
	directed toward the western oil importers. The issue sets include
	(1) development of the emergent oil industries, (2) distribution
	of the profits therefrom, and (3) the control and ownership of the
	oil industries. The model depicting aspects of the evolution of oil
	issues is operationalized utilizing difference equations, and correspondence
	with event/interaction data is tested for two cases: Iran and Saudi
	Arabia. Between 53% and 98% of the variance in measured cooperative

	Adolescents who adapt their substance use behaviour to match that

	strong network selection effects occurring with a preference for

	occurs among cannabis and alcohol but not tobacco users. Homophily
	prevails among tobacco and alcohol users. Cannabis use influences
	smoking behavior positively (i.e., increasing cannabis increases
	smoking). Weaker effects include drinkers smoking more and cannabis
	users drinking more. Homophily and assimilation are not significant
	mechanisms with regard to sporting activity for any substance. There

	in world politics has been documented by scholars, but the literature
	has focused predominantly on nonsecurity ("new") issue areas. Conversely,
	although recent constructivist work in international relations has
	examined the security policies of states, typically it is the state
	that is doing the constrncting of interests. I bridge these two literatures
	by examining the hard case of transnational civil society working
	through issue networks to teach state interests in security policy.
	I analyze the campaign by transnational civil society to generate
	an international norm prohibiting antipersonnel land mines and trace
	the effects of several techniques through which states can be said
	to be socialized. Through generating issues, networking, "grafting,"
	and using a transnational Socratic method to reverse burdens of proof,
	the campaign has stimulated systemic normative change through two
	processes: norm adoption through the conversion of persuaded moral
	entrepreneurs and emulation resulting from social pressures of identity.},

	strong short-term relations in the context of long-term "memories"
	that shape future expectations of their bilateral relations. The
	results indicate that reciprocity in Indo-Pakistani relations is
	shaped by a long-term equilibrium and suggest a reconceptualization
	of the nature of the Indo-Pakistani relations. The findings highlight
	the legacy of suspicions between these two countries, providing sober
	insights into the possibilities for reducing conflict and promoting
	cooperation in South Asia.},

	literature on conflict escalation can be attributed to selection
	bias. To control this bias statistically, I use a censored probit
	model to evaluate hypotheses about conflict escalation over the time
	period of 1950-1985. I report four results. (1) Power parity and
	economic development are found to influence conflict nonmonotonically
	(2) Although joint democracy and joint satisfaction with the status
	quo are found to have robust pacifying effects on the onset of conflict,
	the results suggest that they are unrelated to the escalation of
	disputes to war. (3) Allied pairs of states appear less likely to
	escalate their disputes. (4) Finally, the unified model suggests
	that it is essential for researchers interested in the escalation
	behavior of states to consider first how states become involved in
	disputes. Conflict onset and escalation appear to be related processes.},

  abstract = {Many statistical studies in international relations investigate the
	claim that democracies do not fight one another. Virtually all of
	these studies employ a single-equation design, where the dependent
	variable measures the presence or absence of a dyadic militarized
	interstate dispute (MID). A separate group of studies argues that
	conflict affects democracy and that its effect could be positive
	or negative. By and large, these two bodies of literature have not
	incorporated one another's insights. We argue that democracy and
	dyadic conflict affect each other significantly and that statistical
	models that ignore the reciprocal nature of these effects may make
	incorrect inferences. To test this argument, we develop a simultaneous
	equations model of democracy and dyadic conflict. Our sample includes
	all the politically relevant dyads from 1950 to 1992. We find that
	dyadic military disputes reduce joint democracy and joint democracy
	reduces the probability of MIDs. Compared with the single-equation
	estimates in the literature, the absolute effect of joint democracy
	in our paper is smaller while in relative terms, the effect is similar
	in size. The effect of joint democracy on MID involvement is considerably
	smaller for noncontiguous countries than for contiguous ones. The
	effects of a number of control variables in the MID equation are
	also found to differ from those reported previously in single-equation-based
	studies.},

  abstract = {Social constructivism in international relations has come into its
	own during the past decade, not only as a metatheoretical critique
	of currently dominant neo-utilitarian approaches (neorealism and
	neoliberal institutionalism) but increasingly in the form of detailed
	empirical findings and theoretical insights. Constrnctivism addresses
	many of the same issues addressed by neo-utilitarianism, though from
	a different vantage and, therefore, with different effect. It also
	concerns itself with issues that neo-utilitarianism treats by assumption,
	discounts, ignores, or simply cannot apprehend within its characteristic
	ontology and/or epistemology. The constructivist project has sought
	to open up the relatively narrow theoretical confines of conventional
	approaches--by pushing them back to problematize the interests and
	identities of actors; deeper to incorporate the intersubjective bases
	of social action and social order; and into the dimensions of space
	and time to establish international structure as contingent practice,
	constraining social action but also being (re)created and, therefore,
	potentially transformed by it.},

  abstract = {The research presented here addresses a longstanding but previously
	unsupported theoretical proposition related to social learning in
	the demographic literature. This is that individuals should respond
	to lower (higher) infant mortality of socially proximate others with
	decreased (increased) fertility. On a more general level this problem
	directly concerns the translation of the effects of macro-demographic
	forces such as mortality into micro-level individual behavior through
	social interaction. Using unique data that combine identification
	of individuals belonging to women's social networks with direct measurement
	of these network members' mortality experience, this research demonstrates
	such a linkage. Information concerning the level and variation in
	infant mortality available to women from a small Nepalese mountain
	population in their social networks is seen to influence the tempo
	of their fertility. It is suggested that the methodology employed
	has important implications for quantitative analyses of reciprocal
	processes of social construction and micro-macro linkages more generally.},

	of material capability of two proximate national actors predicts
	to the onset of an event, for example, war or peace. It is further
	posited that a faster rate of change is perceived by decision-makers
	as threatening, and, thus, they prepare for and initiate war. Utilizing
	COW data to establish system share capability and thereby determine
	velocity of dyadic ratio change prior to the event (war or no war),
	the hypothesis was tested controlling for contiguity and century.
	The findings give moderate to strong support to the theory. In general,
	the trend was in the right direction. In addition, low velocity of
	change strongly approaches a sufficient condition for peace, and
	high velocity of change moderately approaches a necessary condition
	for war.},

  abstract = {We present a unified theory and test of extended immediate deterrence-unified
	in the sense that we employ our theoretical deterrence model as our
	statistical model in the empirical analysis. The theoretical model
	is a straightforward formalization of the deterrence logic in Huth
	(1988) and Huth and Russett (1984), coupled with private information
	concerning utilities. Our statistical analysis suggests that the
	attacker and defender's decisions are influenced by the balance of
	forces, nuclear weapons, defender-protege military alliances, arms
	transfers, and trade, as well as the regime types of those involved.
	Many of these findings contradict previous research by Huth (1988)
	and Huth and Russett (1988). We find that many of the variables involved
	in the deterrence calculus are nonmonotonically linked to the probability
	of deterrence success or war. We illustrate the results with case
	studies of the Soviet-Japanese dispute over Manchukuo (1937-1938)
	and the Berlin Blockade (1948).},

  title = {New Specifications for Exponential Random Graph Models},
  journal = {Sociological Methodology},
  year = {2006},

  pages = {99-153},
  abstract = {The most promising class of statistical models for expressing structural
	properties of social networks observed at one moment in time is the
	class of exponential random graph models (ERGMs), also known as p*
	models. The strong point of these models is that they can represent
	a variety of structural tendencies, such as transitivity, that define
	complicated dependence patterns not easily modeled by more basic
	probability models. Recently, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithms
	have been developed that produce approximate maximum likelihood estimators.
	Applying these models in their traditional specification to observed
	network data often has led to problems, however, which can be traced
	back to the fact that important parts of the parameter space correspond
	to nearly degenerate distributions, which may lead to convergence
	problems of estimation algorithms, and a poor fit to empirical data.
	This paper proposes new specifications of exponential random graph
	models. These specifications represent structural properties such
	as transitivity and heterogeneity of degrees by more complicated
	graph statistics than the traditional star and triangle counts. Three
	kinds of statistics are proposed: geometrically weighted degree distributions,
	alternating k-triangles, and alternating independent two-paths. Examples
	are presented both of modeling graphs and digraphs, in which the
	new specifications lead to much better results than the earlier existing
	specifications of the ERGM. It is concluded that the new specifications
	increase the range and applicability of the ERGM as a tool for the
	statistical analysis of social networks.},

  pages = {pp. 728-750},

  abstract = {Two fundamental arguments are presented to answer whether dyadic balances
	or preponderances of military capability are more peaceful. First,
	the impact of the dyadic balance of military capabilities on interstate
	conflict, conditional on the level of dyadic interest similarity,
	is assessed. Many theoretical works in the field argue that the degree
	of interest similarity gives meaning to the balance of military forces,
	yet few empirical studies investigate the conditionality of these
	two variables. The second argument is that interstate conflict is
	a heterogeneous outcome. A selection model that seeks to explain
	the severity of interstate disputes is used to address this concern.
	Using data from all interstate dyads between 1886 and 1992, results
	show that dyads with similar interests have less severe disputes,
	and under the condition of interest dissimilarity, balances rather
	than preponderances of military capability are associated with less
	severe disputes.},

	study of 272 superior-subordinate dyads produced results that support
	the notion that increasing dissimilarity in superior-subordinate
	demographic characteristics, referred to here as "relational demography,"
	is associated with lower effectiveness as perceived by superiors,
	less personal attraction on the part of superiors for subordinates,
	and increased role ambiguity experienced by subordinates. These effects
	were found even after we controlled for the effects of simple demographic

	via overt military acts or covert machinations. In many cases, they
	argue that dyadic democratic interventions (DDIs) occur more frequently
	than would be expected given the number of jointly democratic dyads
	in the international system. I examine their research design and
	suggest changes to their concepts of states, interventions, and regime
	type, as well as their sample size and definition of dyads in the
	international system. I implement these changes and retest such arguments
	on a sample of interventions from 1945 to 1991. I find 11 cases where
	a democracy intervenes against another democracy, but these cases
	are rare in comparison to interventions conducted by democratic and/or
	autocratic states in undemocratic states, or by autocratic states
	against democratic states. Furthermore, these DDIs are less likely
	to occur than the presence of democracy in the international system
	would suggest.},

	paradigm's research program. This article applies Lakatos's criterion
	that a series of related theories must produce problemshifts that
	are progressive rather than degenerating to appraise the adequacy
	of realist-based theories on the balancing of power advanced by neotraditionalists.
	This research program is seen as degenerating because of (1) the
	protean character of its theoretical development, (2) an unwillingness
	to specify what constitutes the true theory, which if falsified would
	lead to a rejection of the paradigm, (3) a continual adoption of
	auxiliary propositions to explain away flaws, and (4) a dearth of
	strong research findings.},

	First, his reliance on Imre Lakatos's (1970) model of scientific
	progress is problematic, because the Lakatosian model has been largely
	rejected by contemporary historians and philosophers of science.
	Second, Vasquez understates the range and diversity of the realist
	research program and mistakenly sees disagreements among realists
	as evidence of theoretical degeneration. Finally, he overlooks the
	progressive character of contemporary realist theory, largely because
	he does not consider all the relevant literature. Disagreements within
	and across competing research programs are essential to progress
	and should be welcomed, but Vasquez's effort suggests that criticism
	will be most helpful when it seeks to do more than merely delegitimate
	a particular research tradition.},

	for judging theories and evaluating research programs. Vasquez claims
	that facts observed can falsify a theory by showing that its predictions
	are wrong. He fails to consider the puzzles posed by the interdependence
	of theory and fact. He places all realists in a single paradigm despite
	the divergent assumptions of traditional and structural realists.
	In contrast to Vasquez, I argue that explanation, not prediction,
	is the ultimate criterion of good theory, that a theory can be validated
	only by working back and forth between its implications and an uncertain
	state of affairs that we take to be the reality against which theory
	is tested, and that the results of tests are always problematic.},

  abstract = {The authors examine a standard gravity model of international commerce
	augmented to include political as well as institutional influences
	on bilateral trade. Using annual data from 1980-2001, they estimate
	regression coefficients and residual dependencies using a hierarchy
	of models in each year. Rather than gauge the generalizability of
	these patterns via traditional measures of statistical significance
	such as p-values, this article develops and employs a strategy to
	evaluate the out-of-sample predictive strength of various models.
	The analysis of recent international commerce shows that in addition
	to a typical gravity-model specification, political and institutional
	variables are important. The article also demonstrates that the often-reported
	link between international conflict and bilateral trade is elusive,
	and that inclusion of conflict in a trade model can sometimes lead
	to reduced out-of-sample predictive performance. Further, this article
	illustrates that there are substantial, persistent residual exporter-
	and importer-specific effects, and that ignoring such patterns in
	relational trade data results in an incomplete picture of international
	commerce, even in the context of a well-established framework such
	as the gravity model.},

	types: rival explanations and explanations complementary but deeper
	in the causal chain. The second contrast begins with a different
	question: What kind of knowledge is needed to design institutions
	in the real world? Asking this question reveals epistemological differences
	between positive social science and institutional design that can
	be traced to different orientations toward time. Making institutions
	is about the future and has an intrinsic normative element. Explaining
	institutions is about the past and does not necessarily have this
	normative dimension. To avoid "driving with the rearview mirror"
	we need two additional kinds of knowledge beyond that developed in
	this volume, knowledge about institutional effectiveness and knowledge
	about what values to pursue. As such, the problem of institutional
	design is a fruitful site for developing a broader and more practical
	conception of social science that integrates normative and positive
	concerns.},

  abstract = {The claim that international institutions can transform state interests
	is central to neoliberal challenges to the realist assumption that
	"process" (interaction and learning among states) cannot fundamentally
	affect system "structure" (anarchy and the distribution of capabilities).
	Systematic development of this claim, however, has been hampered
	by the neoliberals' commitment to rational choice theory, which treats
	interests as exogenously given and thus offers only a weak form of
	institutional analysis. A growing body of international relations
	scholarship points to ways in which the identities and interests
	of states are socially constructed by knowledgeable practice. This
	article builds a bridge between this scholarship and neoliberalism
	by developing a theory of identity- and interest-formation in support
	of the neoliberal claim that international institutions can transform
	state interests. Its substantive focus is the realist view that anarchies
	are necessarily self-help systems, which justifies disinterest in
	processes of identity- and interest-formation. Self-help is a function
	not of anarchy but of process and, as such, is itself an institution
	that determines the meaning of anarchy and the distribution of power
	for state action. The article concludes with an examination of how
	this institution can be transformed by practices of sovereignty,
	by an evolution of cooperation, and by critical strategic practice.},

  abstract = {In 1973 Granovetter formulated the strength-of-weak-ties hypothesis
	(SWT), which became the foundation of a vast sociological literature
	on social networks in labor markets. Until now, SWT has never been
	directly tested but treated instead as a surrogate for the relationship
	between an actor's network and labor market outcomes such as characteristics
	of a job obtained. The paper restates SWT as a proposition about
	the probability of getting a job as a function of within-actor differences
	in tie strength and tests it with data on hires carried out in one
	Russian city in 1998. In support of SWT, the results show that a
	worker is more likely to get a job through one of her weak ties rather
	than strong ties. The advantages of weak ties lie in their abilities
	to provide timely access to non-redundant information and to influence
	employers directly. In contrast, strong ties are associated with
	indirect influence on employers through well-connected intermediaries.
	The estimates come from a within-worker fixed-effect conditional
	logistic regression and thereby provide rare evidence of an association
	between information and influence transferred through social ties
	and labor market outcomes, independent of workers' individual characteristics.},
